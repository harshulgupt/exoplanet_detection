# 🌍 Climate Trends & Exoplanet Discoveries: A Data-Driven Analysis  

## Overview  
This project presents a **comprehensive data-driven analysis** of two critical scientific domains: **climate change trends** and **exoplanet discoveries**. By leveraging Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques, this study aims to uncover insights into global temperature variations and the rapid expansion of exoplanet detections.

The key areas of analysis include:
- 📈 **Historical Global Temperature Trends (1900-2021)** – Investigating long-term warming patterns.
- 🪐 **Exoplanet Discoveries & Discovery Methods (1990-2021)** – Analyzing detection rates and techniques.
- 📊 **Advanced Statistical Analysis & Visualizations** – Applying statistical methods to interpret trends.
- 🔬 **Machine Learning Applications (Future Work)** – Exploring predictive modeling potential.

## Project Scope  
### 1. Climate Change Data Analysis  
Global temperature data from 1900 to 2023 is examined to identify **long-term climate trends**. The dataset contains yearly maximum, minimum, and average temperatures. Various statistical techniques are applied, including **polynomial regression**, to detect the extent of global warming.
